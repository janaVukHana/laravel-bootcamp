WHAT IS BREEZE
Laravel Breeze is a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, 
including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. 
In addition, Breeze includes a simple "profile" page 
where the user may update their name, email address, and password.

BREEZE OR UI 
BREZZE offering a more up-to-date version of laravel/ui . 
It provides the same authentication functionality as laravel/ui , 
but uses Tailwind instead of Bootstrap, and does not include presets for Vue or React.

// -mrc make also migration and resource
php artisan make:model -mrc MODEL_NAME

Because we're using a resource controller, 
we can use a single Route::resource() statement to define all of the routes 
following a conventional URL structure

The auth middleware ensures that only logged-in users can access the route.
The verified middleware will be used if you decide to enable email verification.
